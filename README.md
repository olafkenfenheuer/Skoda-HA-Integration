# Škoda Connect for Home Assistant

[🇬🇧 English](README.md) | [🇩🇪 Deutsch](README.de.md) | [🇳🇱 Nederlands](README.nl.md)

A multi-language [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) custom integration for
Škoda vehicles, built on the official
[MyŠkoda Public API](https://public.api.connect.skoda-auto.cz/docs). It talks to the API
directly with an **API key** - no username/password and no third-party client library.

> **Unofficial project.** This integration is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated
> with Škoda Auto. Use at your own risk.

## Features

Built following Home Assistant's current integration best practices: a UI-only config flow,
a `DataUpdateCoordinator` for efficient polling, entity descriptions, per-entity translations,
an options flow, reauthentication support, and a diagnostics download.

| Platform | Entities |
|---|---|
| `sensor` | Battery level, charging power, charge limit (read-only), charging rate, remaining charging time, battery/total range, fuel level, AdBlue range, mileage, target temperature, address of the parking position, name of the charging location profile currently active, API status (result of the last poll, diagnostic), last poll (date and time of the last successful poll, diagnostic), rate limit until (when the request quota is available again after a rate limit, diagnostic), API requests remaining (left of the hourly quota according to the last response, with the attributes `limit` and `reset_at`, diagnostic) |
| `binary_sensor` | Doors, windows, trunk, bonnet, lights, central locking, charging, charging cable plugged in, vehicle at saved charging location |
| `device_tracker` | Parking position (shows on the Map dashboard; unknown while driving) |
| `climate` | Remote air conditioning (on/off, active ventilation, target temperature) |
| `switch` | Start/stop charging |
| `button` | Poll API now (queries the MyŠkoda API for the vehicle immediately; costs one request of the API quota and is refused while the API is rate limited) |
| `number` | Charge limit (target state of charge), per-vehicle polling intervals (normal / while charging) |
| `select` | Charge mode |

Sensors and controls are only created for the data and remote operations your specific vehicle
reports, so the entity list adapts to your car (EV, PHEV, or combustion).

A **read-only mode** can be enabled in the integration options to disable all remote controls
while keeping all sensors active.

### What the public API does not offer

Compared to earlier versions (which used the app's private API) the following are no longer
possible, because the public API has no endpoint for them: locking/unlocking, honk & flash,
waking up the vehicle, window heating, battery care mode, reduced charging current, outside
temperature and software version. The lock is now a read-only `binary_sensor`; the other
entities were removed.

## Supported languages

The integration ships translations for its config flow, options flow, and entity names in:

- English (`en`)
- Nederlands (`nl`)
- Deutsch (`de`)
- Français (`fr`)
- Čeština (`cs`)
- Slovenčina (`sk`)

Home Assistant automatically picks the translation matching your instance's language setting,
falling back to English. Contributions for additional languages are welcome — add a new file
under `custom_components/skoda_connect/translations/`.

This documentation itself is available in [English](README.md),
[Deutsch](README.de.md) and [Nederlands](README.nl.md).

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

1. In HACS, go to **Integrations** → menu (⋮) → **Custom repositories**.
2. Add this repository URL (`https://github.com/max1weber/Skoda-HA-Integration`) with
   category **Integration**.
3. Search for "Škoda Connect" in HACS, click **Download**, and install it.
4. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Copy the `custom_components/skoda_connect` folder into your Home Assistant
   `config/custom_components/` directory, so you end up with
   `config/custom_components/skoda_connect/manifest.json`.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

1. In the MyŠkoda app, create an API key at <https://go.skoda.eu/api-keys> and select the
   vehicle(s) it should be valid for. Keys are bound to those vehicles and expire.
2. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration** and search for "Škoda Connect".
3. Enter the API key and the VIN of each vehicle (several VINs separated by commas). The API
   has no vehicle list endpoint, so the VINs have to be entered manually.
4. Home Assistant validates the key and creates one device per vehicle with all applicable
   entities.
5. After setup, open the integration's **Configure** dialog to change:
   - the polling interval (3-1440 minutes, default 10),
   - the shorter polling interval used **while charging** (default 5),
   - whether that charging interval is **also used while the cable is plugged in** (default off),
   - read-only mode.

You can replace the API key (or change the VINs) at any time - before it expires, or after creating a
new one - via **Settings → Devices & Services → Škoda Connect → ⋮ → Reconfigure**. The entry is reloaded
and keeps its entities, history and options.

When the key expires (the API reports `api-key-expired`) Home Assistant shows a
"reauthenticate" notification - create a new key and enter it to restore the connection
without losing entity history.

### Upgrading from 0.2.x

Existing entries used your MySkoda email and password, which the public API does not accept.
After updating, Home Assistant asks you to reauthenticate: enter a new API key and the VIN(s).
Entity IDs and history of the entities that still exist are preserved.

## Notes on the API

The integration only uses the documented endpoints under
`https://public.api.connect.skoda-auto.cz/api/v1/vehicles/{vin}` and authenticates with the
`X-API-Key` header. Data is refreshed by polling.

### Per-vehicle polling intervals

Every vehicle has two `number` entities (configuration category): **Polling interval** and
**Polling interval while charging**. They override the defaults from the integration options for
that vehicle, apply immediately without reloading, and can be set from automations
(`number.set_value`). A vehicle is polled at its charging interval as soon as the last fetched
state is `CHARGING`. With the option "Use the charging interval while the cable is plugged in" it
is also used as soon as the charging cable is plugged in - useful to catch the start of a
timer-controlled charge, but the faster interval then stays active for as long as the car remains
plugged in. After a charge starts it can take up to one normal interval until the faster polling kicks
in; starting charging from Home Assistant refreshes the vehicle after 30 seconds, so it switches over
right away.

The switch **Fast polling while plugged in** (configuration category) does the same per vehicle:
it overrides the global option for that vehicle.

### Rate limits

The API currently allows **20 requests per hour per VIN** (documented as not final). A poll
costs one request per vehicle, and every remote command costs one more. Therefore this
integration:

- Defaults to a 10-minute polling interval (6 requests/hour) with a 3-minute minimum (3 minutes alone use the whole quota of 20 requests/hour, leaving no room for
  commands), and to 5 minutes
  while a vehicle is charging, or plugged in if you enable that option (12 requests/hour - leave room
  for commands).
- Does not refresh after every command; commands are accepted asynchronously (HTTP 202), so
  it schedules a single refresh 30 seconds after the last command.
- Detects HTTP 429 responses and pauses polling, for the wait time reported by the API (`Retry-After`, `RateLimit-Reset` or the error
  message, plus 30 seconds; at most 1 hour, 15 minutes if the API gives no wait time), and logs a warning when this happens.
- Keeps the last known state of a vehicle if only its request failed.

Parts of the vehicle the API cannot report (for example because the vehicle is asleep) are
simply omitted from its response; the corresponding entities are created once the data is
available, which can require reloading the integration.
